*Notes:* This is a guide that follows a specific training course that I did not take. Though the overall structure is useful. So we're going to start with it to give an overview of the process of building a startup.

####Structure of the Guide

"This guide is comprised of twelve chapters. In one respect, each chapter is a sequential step in starting a company. There is no need to form a company until you have validated the idea; no need to secure the intellectual property until you have conducted primary research, developed a prototype, and scrubbed the business plan. If you have already completed some of these steps, feel free to skip ahead, but review the suggestions to make sure you haven’t missed anything. Like the cornerstones of a solid foundation, each step in starting a solid business is built upon the ones before it.
Each chapter begins with a verb, .i.e., validate, form, conduct, develop, create, etc. This is to reinforce that you are moving from simulation to reality, from learning and thinking to planning and action. After all the thinking and planning, the thing that matters most is what you DO to advance your idea and turn it into a viable business." (2, Startup Resource Guide) 

"Each chapter is broken into four parts:
Introduction: Offers some advice based on years of real-world experience. It sets the stage for what you should decide and do.
Things to Think About and Decide: Offers suggestions on how to approach the topic of the chapter. Think, Decide, Do.
Things to Do (or not): Offers a list of do’s and don’ts, but probably covers some best practices you may not have thought about.
Recommended Readings and Resources: Offers links to best-in-class books, tools, templates, web sites, and services that can help you start and build your business. This is the real value of this guide. Mix and match the readings and resources to create your personal blueprint for success."(2 Startup Resource Guide)
