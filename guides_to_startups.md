*Notes:* This is a guide that follows a specific training course that I did not take. Though the overall structure is useful. So we're going to start with it to give an overview of the process of building a startup.

####Structure of the Guide

"This guide is comprised of twelve chapters. In one respect, each chapter is a sequential step in starting a company. There is no need to form a company until you have validated the idea; no need to secure the intellectual property until you have conducted primary research, developed a prototype, and scrubbed the business plan. If you have already completed some of these steps, feel free to skip ahead, but review the suggestions to make sure you haven’t missed anything. Like the cornerstones of a solid foundation, each step in starting a solid business is built upon the ones before it.
Each chapter begins with a verb, .i.e., validate, form, conduct, develop, create, etc. This is to reinforce that you are moving from simulation to reality, from learning and thinking to planning and action. After all the thinking and planning, the thing that matters most is what you DO to advance your idea and turn it into a viable business." (2, Startup Resource Guide) 

"Each chapter is broken into four parts:
Introduction: Offers some advice based on years of real-world experience. It sets the stage for what you should decide and do.
Things to Think About and Decide: Offers suggestions on how to approach the topic of the chapter. Think, Decide, Do.
Things to Do (or not): Offers a list of do’s and don’ts, but probably covers some best practices you may not have thought about.
Recommended Readings and Resources: Offers links to best-in-class books, tools, templates, web sites, and services that can help you start and build your business. This is the real value of this guide. Mix and match the readings and resources to create your personal blueprint for success."(2 Startup Resource Guide)

### Startup Resource Guide Chapter - Validate

"“Here’s the difference between a visionary and an entrepreneur. Both have visions, which are a dime a dozen. But an entrepreneur has, in addition to visions, plans. In addition to plans, actions.”
– Bob Metcalfe (Founder of 3Com and inventor of Ethernet)"
(4 - SRG)

**Think "Project" or "Experiment" and Don't Limit Your Focus Too Early** 
"think about your idea as a “project,” or an “experiment,” not as a business. Once the project achieves certain milestones (see below), you can turn it into a business. *Many people will tell you to “focus, focus, focus” on one idea. That’s actually bad advice. It is okay to try lots of different ideas until one sticks -- until it keeps you up at night and forces you to do nothing but it. The right idea will find you.* You will know you have the right idea when your enthusiasm is not driven solely by your love for the idea, but by the love for the idea from people who will buy it." (5 SRG - emphasis mine)

**Simplify, simplify, simplify (the three keys to success)** 
"think about how to simplify the idea. Too much has to happen before anything can happen, so the simpler it is, the more likely it can be done. If your idea requires a lot of complexity or ongoing customization to serve the market, think hard about its viability and your ability to make it happen." (5 -SRG) 

Simplicity is likely very tough to manage - though it is critical to success vis-a-vis manageability. For small ventures, side ventures, projects that are a means to growth rather than to, say, gaining investory attention or otherwise - this is especially important. 

#####Revenue Focus - the one place to get single-minded
"decide on ONE revenue stream. Use that to guide you on exactly what it is you are building and in what order. Think about your ability to build the product and bring it to market without any outside capital. Do you have the capital, or access to friends and family capital? Most investors don’t
invest in ideas or to build product, they invest in traction and growth -- traction with paying customers and growth in sales and profits." (SRG 5-6)

** *[[[[This will require additional attention - what does this mean and how to apply it!!! ]]]]* **

** * How to check and see if there are existing ideas / products out there doing what you hope to do: * **
"Follow blogs that cover your market. Checkout Go2Web20 to see if there are similar sites on the market as the one you have in mind."

Excellent set of resources on page 7 of SRG - research and pull in the best ideas from these.

###Notes from Startup Resource Guide Chapter - "Form the Company"

"“The only thing worse than starting something and failing... is not starting something.”
—Seth Godin, Squidoo founder, author and blogger"
(SRG page 8) 

**On Forming a Company - Logistics (Legal and Otherwise)

"
Even though you may still be in the idea stage and not yet sure whether the opportunity you have identified can be turned into a viable business, you should form a legal entity if you plan to pursue it. A legally-formed company affords you and your idea protections that are not available to you as an individual. Most startup companies are corporations, not sole proprietorships. A corporation limits shareholder liability, is a repository for intellectual property and other assets, and provides a vehicle for inbound investment.

*The first thing to come to grips with is that YOU are not your company.* Your company is a creature of the law. Your company has a life of its own. It wants to survive and it wants to protect itself, even from you. What is best for your company is not necessarily best for you. The role you play determines your obligations and your liability. As an officer and/or director of your startup company, the law will hold you accountable. And the minute you hire someone, or take investment money from someone, or enter into a business contract with someone, your obligations and liabilities increase exponentially." [emphasis mine SRG 8)

###Important - Pages 8 - 10 dense but necessary legal and financial info re Incorporating - need to review

###Notes from the Startup Resource Guide chapter "Form the Team" 

"“You need three things to create a successful startup:
to start with good people, to make something customers
actually want, and to spend as little money as possible.”
― Paul Graham" (11 SRG) 

**On the Importance of a Strong Team**
"Most venture capitalists invest more on the strength of the team than on any other factor. It is often said among investors, “We bet on the jockey, not on the horse.”" 

**On the Power of Two**

"How many founders should a startup team have? Studies show that two founders are ideal. Famous founder duos include Hewlett-Packard (HP), Gates-Allen (Microsoft), Lerner-Bosack (Cisco), and Jobs-Wozniak (Apple). With duos, one is usually good at business development and the other good at product development." (11 SRG)

**Required Documents / Points to Consider **

"What does it mean to “form” the core team? It means the business must have a Founders Agreement, Shareholder Buy-Sell Agreement, Stock Vesting Agreement and Schedule, and other legal instruments that institutionalize the role, responsibilities and compensation of the core team. Many startups have failed or suffered serious setbacks because the founders and/or core team operated on a hand shake or weak organizational and management documents." (SRG 11)

###Hiring

**Key questions to ask of a new hire**

"Hire everyone based on the three-way test: 1) Can s/he do the job (competency)? 2) Will s/he do the job (capability)? 3) Can we stand to work with her or him as s/he does the job (chemistry)?" (SRG 12)

**Practice and Prep for Future Hiring, Keeping Abreast of the Job Market, and Building a Vision of the Company from a Hiring Perspective** 

"Research related job postings from similar companies and write job descriptions that include a compelling business vision, clear descript
ion of each role you need to hire, and list of critical skills. Do this for every key role you need now or in the future. Read them weekly, post them to friends and on job boards. This exercise keeps you focused on “who” you must have to eventually succeed." (SRG 12)

###Building a Board of Advisors

* "Identify credible domain experts in your field or in one of the key areas of your product development, and invite three of them to meet you via Google Hangout or Skype. During the conversation, explain your vision and request if you can speak again to get feedback on your approach. Repeat this process until you find three or four domain experts willing to join your board of advisors."

* "Allocate about 15% of the company’s common stock to a stock option pool and issue key employees options which vest over 3-4 years."

* "Create a board of advisors and draft an equity compensation plan and meeting schedule for the advisors. Allocate and issue approximately 0.25% of company stock to each advisor, to be vested over a 2-3 year period."
(SRG 13)

###Startup Resource Guide Chapter - Conduct Primary Market Research 


"“The golden rule for every business man is this:
Put yourself in your customer’s place.” – Orison Swett Marden" (SRG 15)

**The five W's of Knowing your Customer** 

"Who is the paying customer, exactly? What motivates them to purchase your product? Where are they likely to purchase your product? When are they likely to purchase your product? Why would they purchase your product over other solutions? As a bonus, you should also be able to address the How’s: How are they likely to find out about it and how much will they pay for it? Simple questions, but super hard to answer without digging deeply into the needs, wants, and pain points of the customer." (SRG 15) 

####[[Review market research chapter]] 15-17

###Startup Resource Guide Chapter - Develop and Test Product Prototype

“Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes.
It is best to admit them quickly and get on with improving your other innovations.” – Steve Jobs:
(SRG 18) 

"Product prototyping and development is a six-step process:

(1) Collect product, market and competitive data (with an emphasis on primary market research), to validate the “sweet spot” of your product.

(2) Brainstorm features and focus on the one or two critical features that customers want most.

(3) Develop a prototype – even if it is a paper mockup. (4) Test the prototype with target customers.

(5) Measure the customer feedback; rinse and repeat until you have a product specification that customers love.

(6) Build the *real* product on a rapid development schedule and get it into the hands of customers for further testing and refinement."

**Good recommended steps on the way to a MVP**

*All of the below directly quoted from SRG (19-21)*

* Create a use case and a user persona for your product. Validate it with actual users.

* Write one paragraph describing the entire offering that you are trying to create, or have created. Write at least fifteen different key “Features” that your offering needs to have at launch.

* Arrange the “Features” into logical “Groups,” and sort the “Features” by placing the most important “Features” at the top of the “Group” list and the less important ones at the bottom.

* Order the “Groups” by placing the most important “Groups” first, building a basic “Development Roadmap.” Eliminate any less important “Features.”
* Organize “Features” in the most important “Groups” into releases, and identify your first minimum viable product (“MVP”) release that is simple. See http://fndri.com/yVKzvp as a template.

* Write two sentences describing each “Group” and two sentences on the key “Features” in your MVP, and provide a strategy and time estimate to develop each “Feature.”

* Use basic prototyping tools, such as Balsamiq, Protoshare or Divshot to develop a non-functional mockup of your MVP.

* ￼￼Develop a proposal for an aggressive two week product development sprint to complete a series of key features."
(SRG 19-20)
