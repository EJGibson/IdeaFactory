# Copyright, IP, and Legal

Written on Tuesday, September 29, 2015. VM and I set up Gitbook, connected to my GitHub account. I've done some preliminary research re: IP, Copyright, Legal, etc. Partially influenced by my time in the Publishing industry, and also because of my general tendency toward planning, ownership, etc., this has been an important part of the process of working on our project. 

###Social Media and Brand Building Online (this deserves its own chapter

This was something that early on was clear needed work alongside any other business development at hand, including product development. In fact, this bit, along with some solid **social listening**, would help us start to learn a lot of key things that would help us build in a variety of ways: 

* build our business
* build our product(s)
* build our markets
* build our expertise
* build our networks
* build our credibility
* build or skillsets
* build our language skills ('learn the language' of our customers; and our potential collaborators, mentors; teachers; investors; idols; competitors)
* and build our brand(s)

(Here's how your day job can help here - you can:)

* talk to your Marketing and Product Teams
* access training materials (Digital Marketing; Social Media Training; Business Development; Brand Building)
* access your colleagues' expertise - ready-made consultants
* (and build your network in the process)

So we started with Social Media audience building - and the massaging of an online brand. Twitter, something originally set up in a corporate social media workshop back in 2013, was mostly dormant until engagement picked up around the 2015 Nepal earthquake back in April. Impressed by the results, it cropped up here and there - used as a record of interesting articles. It was also a risk-free, benefit-full learning experience: without many followers, mistakes are easily forgiven. Experimentation is reasonable. I discovered hashtags were useful and began including those (it was helpful to follow those via search around the earthquake).

The process went something like this: 

* sign up
* listen and watch
* engage a bit ("Hello, World!" I read this! With link, no hashtags, and there you have it)
* "Hey, hashtags are good"
* "Hey, mentions are good"
* "Hey, DM's anyone?"
* MMM, buffer, Crowdfire, Topsy, etc. etc.

I started getting more serious about social media (Twitter emphasis) when the campaigns I was managing at work became more engaged in those channels. I needed to engage and be there, as well. So I met with a colleague at work (Social Media/Community Marketing Manager) to get the basics down. I proposed my own Handle at work - read all our Corporate Social Media guidelines to get familiar with the core brand alignment, and got to work. 

**Buffer** is amazing and deserves its own section sometime. This was the best recommendation my colleague offered. I use it more personally than professionally. (Though I always stand firm that my personal/professional development helps my corporate professional development, by making me more engaged, and by building a set of skills that are really applicable to the business in many ways). Section to come **how being an entreprenuer (even if you're in the business of failing) helps you be a better employee**. Anyway, my corporate professional strategy was **social listening**, another thing that deserves its own section someday. It's very useful, and very doable, and a very real contribution and skill. As a **trained ethnographer**, (deserves it own section), the listening is something I do all the time, anyway, though it's a legitimized practice in the social media spehere, and there are a number of tools available to assist with this. *more on this another day when i pull from my notes*. 

More elements of my personal/professional strategy are **getting to know your audiences/communities/markets**. This is critical. My **Pragmatic Marketing Training** has taught me well that solving customer problems is the core driving factors for any good Product Manager (and that goes for developers; marketing managers; anyone trying to make something that will be sold. It goes for people, too - remember, **you're always the product**; and it's always the **Startup of You**.

**Need to add - - Biblio reference:** Circular 1 from this site: http://copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#what . From United States Copyright Office (author). Circular 1: Copyright Basics (title). 

###Getting Started with Customer Problems
Thank you, **Pragmatic Marketing**, for being so amazing. It's really streamlined my thinking. I use it in corporate professional world, and personal/professional world. 

We are circling a few customer problems. Our strategy has been informed not only by **PM** but also by reading we've done over time; by my experience watching the business that I'm a part of grow and build, as well as things we've read about investing, the startup world, and general topics of interest. 

One thing that sticks with me - Vinay mentioned that a good strategy for buying **stocks** that will grow is to look around you at what you see people using. **Chipotle** was a good example of this. **Buffalo Wild Wings** and others. So we tried to think of problems that people immediately around us were having, including notably, ourselves. 

###From Customer Problems to Early Ideas###

**Shelf life of a stock idea (online blogs; etc.)**

**Houses** - Mapping out the full picture
* Financial
* Timewise
* Mental bandwidth (decision making - informed by social science ideas)
* recommendations for whether to rent/buy; what you can do to prepare yourself even if you're noy buying (e.g. how to invest smartly while not investing in real estate)

**Target audience**: millennials and other Americans

**Other message**: it's not necessarily the best investment; here's the other side of the coin, and here's how you can still be prepared even while not buying.

**Challenges**: so many dimensions; so much data; so many different customer needs; and potentially - people don't wnat to think of it this way. They buy houses emotionally. It wouldn't take off.

**Connecting more mature audiences to technology** 

###Investigating Copyright
####How does one copyright something? 

Apparently, it used to be a challenge to do this - it used to come only when secured via publication. Though now, copyright is automatically in place. Though as a document by the U.S. government indicates, there are advantages to registration.

"**How to Secure a Copyright**

**Copyright Secured Automatically upon Creation**

*The way in which copyright protection is secured is frequently
misunderstood.* No publication or registration or other action in the Copyright Office is required to secure copyright. See the
following note. There are, however, certain definite advantages
to registration. See Copyright Registration on page 7.

Copyright is secured automatically when the work is created,
and a work is “created” when it is fixed in a copy or
phonorecord for the first time. “Copies” are material objects
from which a work can be read or visually perceived either
directly or with the aid of a machine or device, such as books,
manuscripts, sheet music, film, videotape, or microfilm.
“Phonorecords” are material objects embodying fixations of
sounds (excluding, by statutory definition, motion picture
soundtracks), such as cassette tapes, CDs, or vinyl disks.
Thus, for example, a song (the “work”) can be fixed in sheet
music (“copies”) or in phonograph disks (“phonorecords”),
or both. If a work is prepared over a period of time, the part
of the work that is fixed on a particular date constitutes the
created work as of that date."

####Notice of Copyright

What's this? That official stamp with the 'c' with a circle, along with the year of first copyright. What are the benefits of this? Why go to the trouble? According to our trusty document, page 4 of http://copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf: 

"Use of the notice may be important because it informs
the public that the work is protected by copyright, identifies
the copyright owner, and shows the year of first publication.
Furthermore, in the event that a work is infringed, if a proper
notice of copyright appears on the published copy or copies to
which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access,
then no weight shall be given to such a defendant’s interposition
of a defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation
of actual or statutory damages, except as provided in section
504(c)(2) of the copyright law. Innocent infringement occurs
when the infringer did not realize that the work was protected.

The use of the copyright notice is the responsibility of the
copyright owner and does not require advance permission
from, or registration with, the Copyright Office."

####Details on Notice of Copyright (Visuals)

Again from page 4 of http://copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf: 

"Form of Notice for Visually Perceptible Copies
The notice for visually perceptible copies should contain all
the following three elements:

1 The symbol © (the letter C in a circle), or the word
“Copyright,” or the abbreviation “Copr.”; and

2 The year of first publication of the work. In the case of
compilations or derivative works incorporating previously
published material, the year date of first publication of
the compilation or derivative work is sufficient. The year
date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural
work, with accompanying textual matter, if any, is
reproduced in or on greeting cards, postcards, stationery,
jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful article; and

3 The name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an
abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a
generally known alternative designation of the owner.

Example: © 2011 John Doe"
