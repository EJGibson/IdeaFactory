###Investigating Copyright
####How does one copyright something? 

Apparently, it used to be a challenge to do this - it used to come only when secured via publication. Though now, copyright is automatically in place. Though as a document by the U.S. government indicates, there are advantages to registration.

"**How to Secure a Copyright**

**Copyright Secured Automatically upon Creation**

*The way in which copyright protection is secured is frequently
misunderstood.* No publication or registration or other action in the Copyright Office is required to secure copyright. See the
following note. There are, however, certain definite advantages
to registration. See Copyright Registration on page 7.

Copyright is secured automatically when the work is created,
and a work is “created” when it is fixed in a copy or
phonorecord for the first time. “Copies” are material objects
from which a work can be read or visually perceived either
directly or with the aid of a machine or device, such as books,
manuscripts, sheet music, film, videotape, or microfilm.
“Phonorecords” are material objects embodying fixations of
sounds (excluding, by statutory definition, motion picture
soundtracks), such as cassette tapes, CDs, or vinyl disks.
Thus, for example, a song (the “work”) can be fixed in sheet
music (“copies”) or in phonograph disks (“phonorecords”),
or both. If a work is prepared over a period of time, the part
of the work that is fixed on a particular date constitutes the
created work as of that date."

####Notice of Copyright

What's this? That official stamp with the 'c' with a circle, along with the year of first copyright. What are the benefits of this? Why go to the trouble? According to our trusty document, page 4 of http://copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf: 

"Use of the notice may be important because it informs
the public that the work is protected by copyright, identifies
the copyright owner, and shows the year of first publication.
Furthermore, in the event that a work is infringed, if a proper
notice of copyright appears on the published copy or copies to
which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access,
then no weight shall be given to such a defendant’s interposition
of a defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation
of actual or statutory damages, except as provided in section
504(c)(2) of the copyright law. Innocent infringement occurs
when the infringer did not realize that the work was protected.

The use of the copyright notice is the responsibility of the
copyright owner and does not require advance permission
from, or registration with, the Copyright Office."

####Details on Notice of Copyright (Visuals)

Again from page 4 of http://copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf: 

"Form of Notice for Visually Perceptible Copies
The notice for visually perceptible copies should contain all
the following three elements:

1 The symbol © (the letter C in a circle), or the word
“Copyright,” or the abbreviation “Copr.”; and

2 The year of first publication of the work. In the case of
compilations or derivative works incorporating previously
published material, the year date of first publication of
the compilation or derivative work is sufficient. The year
date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural
work, with accompanying textual matter, if any, is
reproduced in or on greeting cards, postcards, stationery,
jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful article; and

3 The name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an
abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a
generally known alternative designation of the owner.

Example: © 2011 John Doe"
